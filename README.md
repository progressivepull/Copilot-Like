# Copilot-Like
Simple JavaScript app that mimics a “Copilot-like” experience using a Hugging Face model. This example uses Hugging Face’s Inference API to generate code completions based on user prompts, similar to how GitHub Copilot suggests code. 

# To get a Hugging Face API token,
To get a Hugging Face API token, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Hugging Face website.
2. Log in to your Hugging Face account. If you don’t have one, create a free account.
3. After logging in, click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select Settings.
4. In the left sidebar, click on Access Tokens.
5. Click the New token button.
6. Enter a name for your token, select the desired role/scopes (such as “Read”), and click Generate.
7. Copy the generated token and store it securely. You can now use this token with Hugging Face APIs and libraries (like transformers).

**Tip:** Never share your token publicly, and treat it like a password! If you suspect it has been compromised, revoke it immediately from the same Access Tokens page.
